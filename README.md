### 🏃‍♂️ Personal Interests
In my spare time, I enjoy tracking my fitness journey and analyzing the data: [Fitness Analysis Report](https://jiaxiangbu.github.io/learn_workout/fitness_analysis_report.html) and [Workout Notes](https://jiaxiangbu.github.io/learn_workout/fitness_notes_gitbook.html). I also occasionally share thoughts on games like [Nintendo Switch Mario](https://github.com/JiaxiangBU/nintendo_switch_mario).

For questions and discussions from online friends, I maintain a [tutoring repository](https://github.com/JiaxiangBU/tutoring2/issues).
