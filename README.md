I am currently making machine learning models with credit risk, topic models, word embedding and related topics, and doing empirical analysis in spatial economics and [long panels].
If you would like to discuss these things, you can open new issues in  my [tutoring2] repo.

I also have some non-coding things that I update on occasion, for example, my
*[workout notes]*, game notes in *[nintendo_switch_mario]*.
