I am currently working with machine learning models in the areas of credit risk, topic models, word embedding and related topics, and conducting empirical analysis in spatial economics and [long panels] data. If you would like to discuss these topics, please open a new issue in my [tutoring2] repo. 

In addition to coding, I also occasionally update some non-coding things, such as my *[workout notes]* and game notes in *[nintendo_switch_mario]*.
